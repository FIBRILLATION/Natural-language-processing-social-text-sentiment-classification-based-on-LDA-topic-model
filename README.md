81309:Advanced Topics in Machine Learning (K1) § 81310:Advanced Topics in Intelligent Systems (K1) Final project 

project conditions: 
・Model: Freely choose from Gaussian mixture distribution, hidden Markov model, topic model, etc. However, the model must be inferable using approximate inference with Bayesian inference. 
・Inference method: Freely choose from variational inference, Gibbs sampling, etc. However, approximate inference based on Bayesian inference is required. (Point estimation using maximum likelihood estimation or squared error minimization will result in a deduction of points.) 
・Dataset: Can be open data obtained from the Internet, or data created or collected by yourself. 
・Programming: Must be created by yourself. Basic libraries such as numpy and scipy can be used. Libraries that provide methods or models such as scikit-learn are not permitted. Probabilistic programming environments such as PyMC3 and STAN are permitted. Frameworks that achieve automatic differentiation such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are permitted.
